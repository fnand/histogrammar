## What is this and why might I want it?

Histogrammar is a declarative grammar for booking histograms with automatic filling and merging. It simplifies the process of reducing a huge, distributed dataset to a form that can be plotted, especially in a functional workflow like Apache Spark. It is a standardized set of routines available in many programming languages that interoperate by serializing to and from JSON. It also generalizes the concept of histogramming to an algebra of composable primitives, allowing them to be combined in novel ways.

That was the concise overview. Here's a simple example.

```scala
import org.dianahep.histogrammar._
import org.dianahep.histogrammar.histogram._

val px_histogram = Histogram(100, -5, 5, {mu: Muon => mu.px})
val pt_histogram = Histogram(80, 0, 8, {mu: Muon => Math.sqrt(mu.px*mu.px + mu.py*mu.py)})
val cut_histogram = Histogram(100, -5, 5, {mu: Muon => mu.px}, {mu: Muon => mu.py < 0.0})

val all_histograms = Label("px" -> px_histogram, "pt" -> pt_histogram, "cut" -> cut_histogram)

val final_histogram = rdd.aggregate(all_histograms)(new Increment, new Combine)

println(final_histogram("pt").ascii)
```

The `rdd.aggregate` function submits the histograms to Spark, which fills independent partial histograms in each of its worker nodes, combines partial results, and returns the final result for plotting. However, it required very little input from the user. In this example, `rdd` is a dataset of `Muon` objects, which the histograms view in different ways.

## Managing complexity

Most of the code in this snippet is concerned with booking the histograms (setting the range and number of bins) and describing how to fill them with data. The fill rule is given in each histogram's constructor, so that the data analyst doesn't have to maintain the booking in one part of the code, filling in another, and (for distributed jobs) combining in yet another part of the code. In a data analysis with hundreds of histograms, rather than three, this consolidation helps considerably.

The `all_histograms` object in the example above is a mapping from names to histograms. It, too, has a booking-incrementing-combining lifecycle, where its fill rule is to pass all of the data to all of its constituents. It is a sort of "meta-histogram," an aggregator of aggregators.

We could orgnize the histograms into directories by nesting them, because `Label` classes are composable:

```scala
val directories = Label("momentum" -> Label("px" -> ..., "pt" -> ...),
                        "position" -> Label("x" -> ..., "y" -> ...))
```

## Generalized nesting

But what if we wanted to make a histogram of histograms? That is, something like the following:

([source](https://cds.cern.ch/record/213816))

The top row of plots show data in one region of _y_ (rapidity), the bottom show another; each column shows data in a different "bin" of centrality, and the plots themselves are histograms of _m_ (dimuon mass).

Just as we could make directories by nesting the `Label` class, we should be able to make multivariate views of a dataset by nesting histograms. But to do that effectively, we have to decompose histograms into their fundamental components.

## What is a histogram, really?

A histogram is a summary of a dataset, produced by aggregation. There are other ways to summarize a dataset by aggregation: simply counting the number of entries, computing the sum of some quantity, computing a mean or standard deviation, etc. Each of these summarizes the data in a different way, conveying more or less information.

A histogram is a continuous variable that has been discretized (binned) and the number of entries in each bin are simply counted. Thus, we could write a histogram aggregator like this:

```scala
val histogram = Bin(numberOfBins, low, high, fillRule, value = Count())
```

The `Bin` is a container of sub-aggregators, much like `Label`, but its behavior is different. Now consider the following.

```scala
val h2d = Bin(numBinsX, lowX, highX, fillX, value = Bin(numBinsY, lowY, highY, fillY, value = Count())
```

This aggregator divides the space by binning in one continuous variable, `X`, and then further subdivides it by binning in `Y` Then it counts. The result is a two-dimensional histogram, like both of the following:

A so-called "profile plot" is a histogram in which each bin accumulates a mean and standard deviation, rather than a count. The Histogrammar primitive for mean and standard deviation is `Deviate`.

```scala
val profile = Bin(numBinsX, lowX, highX, fillRuleX, value = Deviate(fillRuleY))
```

The appropriate set of primitives can make short work of many common plot types. Most of these are often assembled by hand.

```scala
val efficiency = Fraction({mu: Muon => mu.passesTrigger}, Histogram(120, -2.4, 2.4, {mu: Muon => mu.eta})
```

([source: ROOT](http://www.phys.ufl.edu/~jlow/znunuHbbTriggerStudies/triggerobjects.html))

```scala
val efficiency2d = Fraction({mu: Muon => mu.passesTrigger},
                       Bin(100, -30, 30, {mu: Muon => mu.x}, value =
                           Bin(100, -60, 60, {mu: Muon => mu.y}, value = Count())))
```

Histogram bins turn a numerical feature into categories. But sometimes the data are already categorical.

```scala
val categorical_heatmap = Categorize({d: D => d.femaleReligion}, value =
                              Categorize({d: D => d.maleReligion}, value = Count())
```

([source: plot.ly](http://help.plot.ly/make-a-heatmap/))

<img src="docs/wiki-images/categorical.png">

And that allows us to freely mix categorical and numerical aggregation.

```scala
val mixed = CategoricalStack(Histogram(140, 0, 140000, {d: D => d.salary}), {d: D => d.gender})
```

It also lets us swap one binning strategy with another without affecting anything else in the hierarchy.

  * **Bin:** user specifies number of bins, low edge, and high edge; bins are regularly spaced.
  * **SparselyBin:** user specifies bin width; bins are filled when non-zero using a hash-map (still regularly spaced).
  * **CentrallyBin:** user specifies bin centers, which may be irregularly spaced. Membership is determined by closest center, which makes histogramming a close analogue of clustering in one dimension.
  * **AdaptivelyBin:** user specifies nothing; optimal bin placement is determined by a clustering algorithm.

The last is particularly useful for exploratory analysis: you want to make a plot to understand the distribution of your data, but specifying bins relies on prior knowledge of that distribution. It is also an essential ingredient in estimating medians and quartiles for box-and-whiskers plots, or mini-histograms for violin plots.

```scala
val violin_box = Branch(Categorize({d: D => d.group}, value = AdaptivelyBin({d: D => d.value}),
                        Categorize({d: D => d.group}, value = Quantile({d: D => d.value}))))
```

## Histogrammar does not produce graphics

In the discussion above, I included plots from many different plotting packages. Histogrammar is not a plotting package: it aggregates data and passes the result to your favorite plotter. Usually, the aggregation step is more computationally expensive than plotting, so it's frustrating to have to repeat a time-consuming aggregation just to change a cosmetic aspect of a plot. Aggregation and graphics must be kept separate.

Aggregation primitives are also easier to implement than graphics, so Histogrammar's core of primitives will be implemented in many different programming languages with a canonical JSON representation. A dataset aggregated in Scala can be plotted in Python. Most language-specific implementations recognize common patterns, such as bin-count being a one-dimensional histogram, to generate the appropriate plot.
